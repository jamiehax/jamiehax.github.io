            <h1>About Me</h1>
    
            <h2>Academics</h2>
    
            <p>I am a recent graduate of Middlebury College with a Bachelors of the Arts in Computer Science, with a minor in Spanish. I am passionate about the intersection of technology with social sciences and the humanitarion sector, especially the ability of data analysis and machine learning to assist public policy development.</p>
    
            <p>My undergraduate work has mainly been focused on two areas: data science and machine learning applications, and social science and opinion dynamics. I wrote my <a href="content/thesis.pdf" target="_blank">senior thesis</a> with the computer science department on the role that election systems play in creating polarization within political systems through an agent based model and opinion dynamics approach.</p>
    
            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
    
            <p>In my free time I love to spend time outdoors, mainly though mountain biking, backcountry skiing, and hiking. Some snapshots of this can be seen on the project cards in the project section (as well as a preview of my foray into film photography). I am also a big music fan, both listening and playing. This year, I was lucky enough to be able to write the score to a friend's film thesis (check it out <a href="https://vimeo.com/909536886/14273306e7" target="_blank">here</a>).</p>
