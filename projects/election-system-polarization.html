        <h1>Abstract</h1>

        <p>Ideological polarization affects the ability of democratic governments to function. Levels of ideological polarization have been rising globally in recent years. Many theories have been put forward about potential causes, but the connection between the election system used and the degree of ideological polarization has been less studied. We present an agent based model to simulate plurality and instant-runoff ranked choice election systems based on Bounded Confidence and Attraction-Repulsion opinion updates. We analyze the long term behavior of these models and quantify the degree of ideological polarization as the variance among agent opinions. We provide a set of parameters that cause plurality election systems with Attraction-Repulsion opinion updates to end with high variance while ranked choice election systems end with near-zero variance. We conduct sweeps between four pairs of model parameters and discuss the phase transitions in variance they produce.</p>

        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <h3>Agent Based Models</h3>

        <p>Agent based models, or ABMs, describe a general approach to modeling dynamic systems in which key actors of the system are abstracted into agents. These agents then interact with each other and the environment according to specified rules of interaction. The long term behavior of the model is then studied to gain an understanding of the system it is meant to model. This process of studying the system level behavior of the model that arises as a result of agent interaction is central to ABMs, as it shows the idea of emergent behavior. More generally, emergent behavior is the idea that interactions between low level parts of the system can give rise to complex, system level behavior. Our emergent behavior is polarization, which arises as a result of interactions between the agents in our model. </p>

        <p>A visual representation of our agent based model in two dimensional opinion space is shown below. Candidates are shown as circles and Voters are shown as X's. Voters are colored as the Candidate they support. </p>

        </div>
        
        <p>An important aspect of an Agent Based Model is that these agents can move around in opinion space. Above, the model is shown at time step 500. Below, the model is shown at time step 3000. Notice how the agents have gotten closer in their opinions and formed clusters.</p>

        <h1>Results</h1>

        <p>We looked at two types of opinion updates, <i>Bounded Confidence</i> and <i>Attraction-Repulsion</i>. We also studied two types of election systems, <i>Instant Runoff Ranked Choice</i> and <i>Plurality</i>. This gave us for types of models. We studied the polarization of the models as the variance among the opinions of all agents in the model. The graph below shows the change in polarization (variance) for each model averaged across 1000 runs for one set of parameters.</p>

        </div>

        <p>The graph shows that Instant Runoff Ranked Choice voting led to a 35% decrease in polarization in the Bounded Confidence model under these parameters, while it led to a 3% increase in polarization in the Attraction-Repulsion model. Below is the same graph, but with a different set of parameters. We can see here that Instant Runoff Ranked choice led to a 95% decrease in polarization in Attraction-Repulsion, and a negligible difference in Bounded Confidence.</p>

        <h1>Single Run Examples</h1>

        <p>Finally, I would like to show some examples of the opinion dynamics of single runs.These opinion dynamics plots show how the distribution of agent opinions changes over the course of a run. Voter agents are colored gray, Candidate agents are colored purple, and winning Candidate agents are colored orange. The size of the line corresponds to a scaled version of that agent’s Threshold; larger Candidates can be considered more ”powerful”. These examples should be considered as anecdotal evidence of agent and model behaviors. That is, while it is true that these models can produce this behavior, it may or may not be true that these behaviors are common in runs or represent the average behavior. I am including them because they provide some insight into how the model and agents behave, and they are also just really fun to look at.</p>

        <h2>Intermediate Candidate Effect</h2>

        <p>In some runs, particularly Bounded Confidence opinion update runs, Candidates are able to connect two disparate opinion clusters. Fig. 4.3 shows such a run, where starting around t = 2000, Voters begin to diverge into two disparate opinion groups. Some agents do crossover, but by around t = 6000, all movement between groups has stopped. Shortly after that, however, a Candidate enters the model with an opinion near the middle of the two groups. This Candidate facilitates movement between the two groups by interacting with Voters and attracting them to within the threshold of the other group, at which point the two groups converge. This is not always the case, however.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Ranked Choice Allows for Compromise</h2>

        <p>Ranked choice systems allow for compromising policies in a way that plurality systems may not. Fig. 4.4 provides an example of this, where in the Attraction-Repulsion ranked choice system it is possible for a centrist Candidate to win the election in a highly polarized system. In this run, the Voter population quickly polarizes into two groups at opposite ends of opinion space, and the initial Candidates follow them. At around t = 4,500, several new Candidates enter the race occupying centrist positions. They are not inclined to move much towards either group as they are in an area of high numbers of expected second choice votes. Despite not being near any Voter agents, a centrist Candidate is able to win election at t = 6, 500, while occupying a position between the two polarized groups.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Extreme and Powerful Candidate Effect</h2>

        <p>In some cases, a Candidate occupying an ideologically extreme position is able to become politically powerful, despite not winning an election, through a series of second place finishes. Once they become powerful, they exercise a large influence on the Voter’s nearby them, which is shown through their ability to change the opinions of those Voters. In one example of this, shown in Fig. 4.5, the Voters have formed two opinion clusters, around 0.4 and 0.8 by t = 7, 000. At around t = 8, 000, the Voters begin to converge. However, instead of converging around a mean opinion of the two groups as would usually be the case, they instead converge around the mean opinion of the more ideologically extreme group due to the political influence of this extreme Candidate.</p>

        </div>

        <h2>Centrist Candidates Hold the Middle</h2>

        <p>In Attraction-Repulsion systems, which tend to polarize quickly and acutely, it is possible for a group of centrist Voters to not polarize if there are also centrist Candidates present. Fig. 4.6 shows one such example. Up to around time step 5,000, there is a group of four Candidates, three of which are relatively influential, all centered around an opinion value of 0.6. Despite polarized opinion groups forming on either side of them, this centrist group remains in the middle with a core voter bloc. However, once all but one of these Candidates have exited the race (t = 5000) the centrist Voter group begins to dissolve. The single remaining Candidate is unable to hold the middle group any longer, and by the end of the run, all Voters have moved to one of the polarized groups. The ability of this centrist group of Candidates to hold the middle for that long is noteworthy, as most Attraction-Repulsion runs have reached polarization by time step 5,000 (Fig. 4.1).</p>

        <h1>Parameter Sweeps</h1>

        <p>These figures show the relationship between model parameters and system polarization. Understanding them requires understanding how these paremeters function in the model. If you are interested, I would reccomend reading my thesis. I am putting them here soley because they are fun to look at.</p>

        <h1>Conclusion</h1>

        <p>These results were, of course, obtained through agent based model simulations. While such models are internally valid, in that their results come from explicit rules and formulas, their main emergent patterns are often only observable across a narrow ranges of conditions. Moreover, in order to abstract a complex dynamic process, such as a real world political system, to an ABM, assumptions were made. Each decision about model implementation was itself an assumption. For example, we simulated 100 Voters and 3 to 5 candidates, whereas many real world political systems often include millions of Voters. We also assumed that Candidates move in elections in ways that maximize the number of votes the expect to receive, which may not always be the case. The applicability of these results to real world political systems depends on the generability of the assump- tions made.</p>
