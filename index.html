This is a model of opinion dynamics where agents (in this case the lines) interact with each other and change their opinions as a result of those interactions. If their opinions (here represented by their vertical position) are within some threshold, they move closer in their opinion. As the lines progress across the screen, we can see them form distinct opinion clusters which then head towards their respective consensus.</p>
