        <p id="popup-content-expanded" >This is a visual example of the <i>Bounded Confidence</i> opinion update function. This is a model of opinion dynamics where agents (in this case the lines) interact with eachother and then move as a result of those interactions. These lines live in opinion space, where movements correspond to changing opinions. These opinions are described by the vertical locations of these lines. As the lines move across the screen, they get closer in opinion, forming clusters.</p>
